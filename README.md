# Multi-Model Assignment 

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook Islam_Monirul_Hw5.ipynb, which is part of a data science homework assignment. The notebook demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques applied to solve specific problems.

### File Description
- Data preprocessing steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model development and evaluation
- Visualizations to support findings

The notebook includes imports for the following machine learning models used for training:
- Logistic Regression (sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) (sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier)
- Random Forest Classifier (sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) (sklearn.svm.NuSVC)      

Additionally, it imports functions for data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and decomposition techniques such as PCA (sklearn.decomposition).
